.TH RFC 1 "December 17, 2011" Linux "USER COMMANDS"
.SH NAME
rfc \- download internet RFCs and display them on screen, man-style
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rfc.py [options] [rfc number]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
rfc downloads internet RFCs and displays them on screen. In interactive mode,
screen display is delegated to less(1) which means that less commands such as
regexp searches are available.
.PP
Some attempt is made to remove unnecessary formatting. The RFCs are all
formatted for printing on US letter, which means that there are a lot of extra
line-feeds and form-feeds between pages. rfc tries to remove as much of it as
possible to allow for pleasant reading on screen. Due to the impressive amount
of ASCII art present in RFCs, reflowing the text is hard or impossible, so
readers should set their terminal widths to at least 80 characters wide to read
them comfortably.
.SH SOURCES
.PP
Currently, rfc fetches RFCs from their source, the rfc-editor.org website.  My
intention is to add support for the RFC packages that many distros contain, so
that the program can operate offline as well.
