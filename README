RFC(1)                           USER COMMANDS                          RFC(1)



NAME
       rfc - download internet RFCs and display them on screen, man-style

SYNOPSIS
       rfc [options] [rfc number]

DESCRIPTION
       rfc downloads internet RFCs and displays them on screen. In interactive
       mode, screen display is delegated to less(1) which means that less com-
       mands such as regexp searches are available.

       Some attempt is made to remove unnecessary formatting. The RFCs are all
       formatted for printing on US letter, which means that there are  a  lot
       of  extra  line-feeds and form-feeds between pages. rfc tries to remove
       as much of it as possible to allow for pleasant reading on screen.  Due
       to  the  impressive  amount of ASCII art present in RFCs, reflowing the
       text is hard or impossible, so readers should set their terminal widths
       to at least 80 characters wide to read them comfortably.

SOURCES
       Currently,  rfc fetches RFCs from their source, the rfc-editor.org web-
       site.  My intention is to add support for the RFC  packages  that  many
       distros contain, so that the program can operate offline as well.
